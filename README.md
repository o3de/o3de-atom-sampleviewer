# Atom SampleViewer Project
## Download and Install

This repository uses Git LFS for storing large binary files.  You will need to create a Github personal access token to authenticate with the LFS service.

### Create a Git Personal Access Token

You will need your personal access token credentials to authenticate when you clone the repository.

[Create a personal access token with the 'repo' scope.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)


### (Recommended) Verify you have a credential manager installed to store your credentials 

Recent versions of Git install a credential manager to store your credentials so you don't have to put in the credentials for every request.  
It is highly recommended you check that you have a [credential manager installed and configured](https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core)


### Clone the repository 

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/o3de/o3de-atom-sampleviewer.git
Cloning into 'o3de-atom-sampleviewer'...

# enter your Github username and personal access token

```

If you have the Git credential manager core installed, you should not be prompted for your credentials anymore.
